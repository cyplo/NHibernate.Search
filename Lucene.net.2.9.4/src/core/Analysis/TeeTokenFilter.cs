	/// <summary> Works in conjunction with the SinkTokenizer to provide the ability to set aside tokens
	/// that have already been analyzed.  This is useful in situations where multiple fields share
	/// many common analysis steps and then go their separate ways.
	/// <p/>
	/// It is also useful for doing things like entity extraction or proper noun analysis as
	/// part of the analysis workflow and saving off those tokens for use in another field.
	/// 
	/// <pre>
	/// SinkTokenizer sink1 = new SinkTokenizer();
	/// SinkTokenizer sink2 = new SinkTokenizer();
	/// TokenStream source1 = new TeeTokenFilter(new TeeTokenFilter(new WhitespaceTokenizer(reader1), sink1), sink2);
	/// TokenStream source2 = new TeeTokenFilter(new TeeTokenFilter(new WhitespaceTokenizer(reader2), sink1), sink2);
	/// TokenStream final1 = new LowerCaseFilter(source1);
	/// TokenStream final2 = source2;
	/// TokenStream final3 = new EntityDetect(sink1);
	/// TokenStream final4 = new URLDetect(sink2);
	/// d.add(new Field("f1", final1));
	/// d.add(new Field("f2", final2));
	/// d.add(new Field("f3", final3));
	/// d.add(new Field("f4", final4));
	/// </pre>
	/// In this example, <code>sink1</code> and <code>sink2</code> will both get tokens from both
	/// <code>reader1</code> and <code>reader2</code> after whitespace tokenizer
	/// and now we can further wrap any of these in extra analysis, and more "sources" can be inserted if desired.
	/// It is important, that tees are consumed before sinks (in the above example, the field names must be
	/// less the sink's field names).
	/// Note, the EntityDetect and URLDetect TokenStreams are for the example and do not currently exist in Lucene
	/// <p/>
	/// 
	/// See <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1058">LUCENE-1058</a>.
	/// <p/>
	/// WARNING: {@link TeeTokenFilter} and {@link SinkTokenizer} only work with the old TokenStream API.
	/// If you switch to the new API, you need to use {@link TeeSinkTokenFilter} instead, which offers 
	/// the same functionality.
