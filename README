The goal of this project is to get NHibernate.Search compiled against .Net4 and newest dependencies

BTW, you get .Net4-compatible NHibernate for free.

I've gathered sources of most of the NHibernate.Search's dependencies and provided a common VS2010 solution to compile them all.

WARNING: 
Sources contain my patches to make them work together and compile on .Net4.
I'm working on getting these patches into main dev branches of the respective projects.

Hibernate changes:
Iesi.collections: .Net4's System.Collections.Generic compatibility
HQL handling: Parsers regenerated with newer version of antlr3
