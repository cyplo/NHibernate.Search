This is NHibernate.Search: Compile it yourself for .Net4

I've gathered sources of most of the NHibernate.Search's dependencies and provided a common VS2010 solution to compile them all.

WARNING: Sources contain my patches to make them work together and compile on .Net4.
I'm working on getting these patches into main dev branches of the respective projects.
