    </head>
    <body>
        This package uses synonyms defined by <a href="http:/www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/">
            WordNet</a> to build a Lucene.Net index storing them, which in turn can be 
        used for query expansion. You normally run {@link WordNet.Net.Syns2Index} once 
        to build the query index/"database", and then call {@link 
        WordNet.Net.SynExpand#Expand SynExpand.Expand(...)} to expand a query.
        <p>

                Instructions
            </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Download the <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/3.0/WNprolog-3.0.tar.gz">WordNet 
                        prolog database</a>
                , gunzip, untar etc.
                <li>
                Invoke Syn2Index as appropriate to build a synonym index. It'll take 2 
                arguments, the path to wn_s.pl from that WordNet download, and the index name.
                <li>
                    Update your UI so that as appropriate you call SynExpand.Expand(...) to expand 
                    user queries with synonyms.</li>
