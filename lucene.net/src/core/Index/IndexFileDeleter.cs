	/*
	* This class keeps track of each SegmentInfos instance that
	* is still "live", either because it corresponds to a
	* segments_N file in the Directory (a "commit", i.e. a
	* committed SegmentInfos) or because it's an in-memory
	* SegmentInfos that a writer is actively updating but has
	* not yet committed.  This class uses simple reference
	* counting to map the live SegmentInfos instances to
	* individual files in the Directory.
	*
	* When autoCommit=true, IndexWriter currently commits only
	* on completion of a merge (though this may change with
	* time: it is not a guarantee).  When autoCommit=false,
	* IndexWriter only commits when it is closed.  Regardless
	* of autoCommit, the user may call IndexWriter.commit() to
	* force a blocking commit.
	* 
	* The same directory file may be referenced by more than
	* one IndexCommit, i.e. more than one SegmentInfos.
	* Therefore we count how many commits reference each file.
	* When all the commits referencing a certain file have been
	* deleted, the refcount for that file becomes zero, and the
	* file is deleted.
	*
	* A separate deletion policy interface
	* (IndexDeletionPolicy) is consulted on creation (onInit)
	* and once per commit (onCommit), to decide when a commit
	* should be removed.
	* 
	* It is the business of the IndexDeletionPolicy to choose
	* when to delete commit points.  The actual mechanics of
	* file deletion, retrying, etc, derived from the deletion
	* of commit points is the business of the IndexFileDeleter.
	* 
	* The current default deletion policy is {@link
	* KeepOnlyLastCommitDeletionPolicy}, which removes all
	* prior commits when a new commit has completed.  This
	* matches the behavior before 2.2.
	*
	* Note that you must hold the write.lock before
	* instantiating this class.  It opens segments_N file(s)
	* directly with no retry logic.
