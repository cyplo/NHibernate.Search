	/// <summary>IndexReader is an abstract class, providing an interface for accessing an
	/// index.  Search of an index is done entirely through this abstract interface,
	/// so that any subclass which implements it is searchable.
	/// <p/> Concrete subclasses of IndexReader are usually constructed with a call to
	/// one of the static <code>open()</code> methods, e.g. {@link
	/// #Open(String, boolean)}.
	/// <p/> For efficiency, in this API documents are often referred to via
	/// <i>document numbers</i>, non-negative integers which each name a unique
	/// document in the index.  These document numbers are ephemeral--they may change
	/// as documents are added to and deleted from an index.  Clients should thus not
	/// rely on a given document having the same number between sessions.
	/// <p/> An IndexReader can be opened on a directory for which an IndexWriter is
	/// opened already, but it cannot be used to delete documents from the index then.
	/// <p/>
	/// <b>NOTE</b>: for backwards API compatibility, several methods are not listed 
	/// as abstract, but have no useful implementations in this base class and 
	/// instead always throw UnsupportedOperationException.  Subclasses are 
	/// strongly encouraged to override these methods, but in many cases may not 
	/// need to.
	/// <p/>
	/// <p/>
	/// <b>NOTE</b>: as of 2.4, it's possible to open a read-only
	/// IndexReader using one of the static open methods that
	/// accepts the boolean readOnly parameter.  Such a reader has
	/// better concurrency as it's not necessary to synchronize on
	/// the isDeleted method.  Currently the default for readOnly
	/// is false, meaning if not specified you will get a
	/// read/write IndexReader.  But in 3.0 this default will
	/// change to true, meaning you must explicitly specify false
	/// if you want to make changes with the resulting IndexReader.
	/// <p/>
	/// <a name="thread-safety"></a><p/><b>NOTE</b>: {@link
	/// <code>IndexReader</code>} instances are completely thread
	/// safe, meaning multiple threads can call any of its methods,
	/// concurrently.  If your application requires external
	/// synchronization, you should <b>not</b> synchronize on the
	/// <code>IndexReader</code> instance; use your own
	/// (non-Lucene) objects instead.
