	/// <summary> A {@link Filter} that only accepts documents whose single
	/// term value in the specified field is contained in the
	/// provided set of allowed terms.
	/// 
	/// <p/>
	/// 
	/// This is the same functionality as TermsFilter (from
	/// contrib/queries), except this filter requires that the
	/// field contains only a single term for all documents.
	/// Because of drastically different implementations, they
	/// also have different performance characteristics, as
	/// described below.
	/// 
	/// <p/>
	/// 
	/// The first invocation of this filter on a given field will
	/// be slower, since a {@link FieldCache.StringIndex} must be
	/// created.  Subsequent invocations using the same field
	/// will re-use this cache.  However, as with all
	/// functionality based on {@link FieldCache}, persistent RAM
	/// is consumed to hold the cache, and is not freed until the
	/// {@link IndexReader} is closed.  In contrast, TermsFilter
	/// has no persistent RAM consumption.
	/// 
	/// 
	/// <p/>
	/// 
	/// With each search, this filter translates the specified
	/// set of Terms into a private {@link OpenBitSet} keyed by
	/// term number per unique {@link IndexReader} (normally one
	/// reader per segment).  Then, during matching, the term
	/// number for each docID is retrieved from the cache and
	/// then checked for inclusion using the {@link OpenBitSet}.
	/// Since all testing is done using RAM resident data
	/// structures, performance should be very fast, most likely
	/// fast enough to not require further caching of the
	/// DocIdSet for each possible combination of terms.
	/// However, because docIDs are simply scanned linearly, an
	/// index with a great many small documents may find this
	/// linear scan too costly.
	/// 
	/// <p/>
	/// 
	/// In contrast, TermsFilter builds up an {@link OpenBitSet},
	/// keyed by docID, every time it's created, by enumerating
	/// through all matching docs using {@link TermDocs} to seek
	/// and scan through each term's docID list.  While there is
	/// no linear scan of all docIDs, besides the allocation of
	/// the underlying array in the {@link OpenBitSet}, this
	/// approach requires a number of "disk seeks" in proportion
	/// to the number of terms, which can be exceptionally costly
	/// when there are cache misses in the OS's IO cache.
	/// 
	/// <p/>
	/// 
	/// Generally, this filter will be slower on the first
	/// invocation for a given field, but subsequent invocations,
	/// even if you change the allowed set of Terms, should be
	/// faster than TermsFilter, especially as the number of
	/// Terms being matched increases.  If you are matching only
	/// a very small number of terms, and those terms in turn
	/// match a very small number of documents, TermsFilter may
	/// perform faster.
	/// 
	/// <p/>
	/// 
	/// Which filter is best is very application dependent.
