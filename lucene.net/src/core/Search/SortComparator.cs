	/// <summary> Abstract base class for sorting hits returned by a Query.
	/// 
	/// <p/>
	/// This class should only be used if the other SortField types (SCORE, DOC,
	/// STRING, INT, FLOAT) do not provide an adequate sorting. It maintains an
	/// internal cache of values which could be quite large. The cache is an array of
	/// Comparable, one for each document in the index. There is a distinct
	/// Comparable for each unique term in the field - if some documents have the
	/// same term in the field, the cache array will have entries which reference the
	/// same Comparable.
	/// 
	/// This class will be used as part of a key to a FieldCache value. You must
	/// implement hashCode and equals to avoid an explosion in RAM usage if you use
	/// instances that are not the same instance. If you are searching using the
	/// Remote contrib, the same instance of this class on the client will be a new
	/// instance on every call to the server, so hashCode/equals is very important in
	/// that situation.
	///
